# Easy to fix 
## My final project 

As part of our Information System (B.Sc) degree in Academic Tel Aviv Yaffo Collage, 
me and my team members started a project called "Easy To Fix" - a platform that solves problems inside the city.
The platform is designed for efficient communication of municipal employees with professionals, and is receiving reports as quickly as possible.

The main processes of the project are:
- Addition and management of professionals to the database of municipal employee.
- Receiving the fault information by Restful API from "Report It" group and saving it into municipality's calander.
- Manage the faults on the calendar and transfer them to the relevant professional for solving the fault by using PHPmailer.

Our goal in the project was to facilitate all the factors in the process through digital transposition.

We were happy to work together in order to solve a problem that exists in the city and facilitate the way to handle it.

Technologies we used:
- HTML,CSS,Javascript
- PHP
- Restful api
